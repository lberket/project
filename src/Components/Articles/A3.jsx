Can regular exercise help you sleep better?

Exercise and sleep
</a>
<br />
Regular <strong>exercise</strong> is one of the cheapest and most efficient ways to preserve 
<strong>good health</strong>. Similar can be said about sleep – a whole-body process 
incredibly important both for mental and physical health. Yet, so many people neglect not only sleep, but daily exercise too. More than <strong>50% of adults</strong> in the US 
do not meet the federal Physical Activity Guidelines for aerobic physical 
activity, and only <strong>20%</strong> of adults actually satisfy the guidelines both aerobic 
and muscle-strengthening activity. Combining this with the knowledge that 
more than a <strong>third of adults</strong> sleep poorly implies that a larger number of 
people may not be getting enough sleep and exercise, thus increasing their risk 
for numerous cardiovascular, neurological and metabolic disorders. But how does exercise impact sleep and vice versa? Does regular exercise improve sleep
 and does good sleep improve the quality of exercise? Can exercise serve as 
a treatment option for certain sleep disorders? Many studies have been published on this intriguing relationship in recent years with surprising and encouraging results that may make many people think twice about not exercising regularly.

<a className="paragraph">
Can exercise improve sleep?
</a>
<br />
The short answer is – <strong>yes</strong>. The long answer, though, is slightly more complicated. <a className="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6045928/">Studies</a> have shown that moderate to vigorous intensity exercise can 
increase sleep quality for adults by reducing sleep onset (the time it takes to fall asleep), as well as decrease the amount of time they lie awake in 
bed during the night. Exercise has also been shown to <a className="link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25727885">reduce daily sleepiness</a> and 
the percentage of time spent in light sleep, as well as increase sleep efficiency. However, several studies in young adults showed <a className="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5385214/">mixed results</a> regarding the effect of exercise on sleep, with the authors noting that exercise specifically in the early morning can positively affect sleep.

<p className="article-text">
<strong>Exercise</strong> can be used, along with other interventions, as a <strong>potential 
treatment </strong> for sleep disorders such as sleep apnea or insomnia. Since as many as <a className="link" href="https://learn.aasm.org/">60%</a> obstructive sleep apneas are associated with obesity, you can easily see
 how moderate regular exercise can decrease the risk of sleep apnea. A <a className="link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.664499/full">review</a> showed that self-reported sleep quality, insomnia severity, and daytime 
sleepiness could be <strong>improved or ameliorated with treatment of exercise</strong> too, 
thus showing the wide range of benefits that exercise can have on sleep quality.
</p>
<p className="article-text">
Fewer studies have, however, looked into the opposite: the effect of sleep 
on exercise. The <a className="link" href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/physical-activity/exercise-and-sleep">ones</a> that did, though, showed that people who sleep poorly are less active than those with healthy sleep cycles. Moreover, people who 
sleep poorly are less motivated to exercise and feel sleepier during the 
day which also doesn’t help with motivation. Despite this, too few quality studies have been done to definitively show that good sleep leads to increased physical activity.

    <a className="paragraph">What about exercising right before bed?</a>
    <br />
The traditional view is that exercising up to three hours before bed will 
negatively impact sleep quality due to increased heart rate, body temperature, and adrenaline levels. However, some <a className="link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25087193">studies</a> have shown that exercising before bed can actually be beneficial. Exercising an <strong>hour and a half before bedtime is associated with increased deep sleep</strong> and decreased REM sleep. More specifically, individuals with greater self-perceived exertion du
ring exercise had decreased light sleep and increased deep sleep. Another 
<a className="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4217702/">study</a> showed that the majority of people who exercise after 8:00 pm fell a
sleep quickly and felt well rested the next day, with optimal duration of 
deep sleep. Overall, is seems like <strong>exercising before bedtime isn’t harmful 
for sleep</strong>, but vigorous workouts in the hour leading up to bed can <a className="link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-018-1015-0">affect</a> sleep efficiency. This should not be a major worry for the majority of the
 population, though, since less than <a className="link" href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/physical-activity/exercise-and-sleep">5%</a> of people exercise an hour before 
 bedtime on a daily or monthly basis.

So can exercise help improve your sleep quality? Most studies agree <strong>regular 
exercise has a beneficial effect on sleep</strong>, but some questions regarding the 
type, intensity and regularity of exercise remain. Regardless, exercise per se has considerable benefits for health, and even if it has only a small benefit on sleep quality (let alone a big one), it seems like a <strong>good idea to put on those sneakers</strong> and go for a nice jog tomorrow….well maybe today.
