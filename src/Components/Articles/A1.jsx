            <h2 className="title">Back to school - later? Sleep, school start times and academic performance</h2>
            <p className="article-text">




                We all know good <a id="bold">sleep</a> is one of the main <a id="bold">pillars </a>
                of <a id="bold">mental</a>  and <a id="bold">physical</a> health.
                Therefore, it is alarming to hear that a third of adults have trouble sleeping at any
                given time, elevating their risk of a whole spectrum of cardiometabolic, neurological
                and psychiatric disorders in the long term. But what if I told you that, according to the
                US Center for disease control and Prevention (CDC), up to <a className="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7024093/">70% of adolescents</a> sleep less
                than the recommended 8-10 hours on a given school day? Quite worrying, right? What’s more,
                short sleep at this age can <a className="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5812312/">increase the risk</a> for <strong>obesity, diabetes, injuries, poor mental
                health, attention </strong>and<strong> behavior problems</strong>. But why do they sleep poorly and how does it
                reflect on their academic performance which can determine a significant part of their
                future professional life?
            </p><p className="article-text">
                There are a couple of fundamental reasons for why teenagers sleep shorter than they should.
                Adolescents typically have a preference to stay active until late in the evening and to
                wake up late in the morning. During puberty, a period in life with many physiological
                changes, a teen’s sleep schedule also changes. The <strong>circadian rhythm</strong>, i.e. the body’s
                internal clock that controls the sleep/wake cycle, <strong>shifts a couple of hours later</strong>, thus
                making adolescents feel sleepy only later in the evening, around 10pm-12am. This
                completely natural shift is called <strong>sleep phase delay</strong>. Despite adolescents feeling sleepy
                later, they still need their 8-10 hours of nocturnal sleep. However, school in many
                countries around the world starts around 8am (or even 7am). Now it is easy to see why
                so many children, suddenly during adolescence, do not get enough sleep. Sometimes, they
                try to oversleep on the weekends which is also not great since the consistency of time
                of going to bed and waking up across the week is important for sleep quality. Needless
                to say that if teens go to bed late during the weekend, this “sleep debt” accumulates
                which significantly impedes their cognitive and academic performance in school.
            </p><p className="article-text">
                Why does this delay in sleep even happen? Unfortunately, we’re not sure yet. One reason
                for this could be an apparent <a className="link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780444538178000086?casa_token=Jt4m0C5W5-cAAAAA:-LR-Tw6COY7fWMDCbjCaw_ajfs-8kr3gVZcom6St0_0IQkxt9RFED4unhXiL4DEmpvrwWgx2Ek8">
                    lengthening of the circadian period</a> during the teenage years,
                 which typically leads to a later onset of the biological night. Furthermore, some studies mention 
                 that the adolescent <a className="link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0748730404274265">circadian clock is less sensitive to light</a> during the morning when light 
                 usually advances the circadian clock and its timing of sleep. Finally, the homeostatic regulation of sleep, which increases sleep pressure with waking hours, <a className="link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2005.00467.x">could be altered in adolescents</a>, leading to delayed sleepy feeling.
            </p><p className="article-text">
                How does this shorter than optimal sleep affect adolescents’ academic performance?
                 <strong> Without enough sleep</strong>, numerous studies have shown that children can have <strong>problems</strong> with
                  <strong> attention, memory, problem-solving,</strong> and <a className="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4075951/">mood</a>. Poor sleep can also contribute to 
                  emotional issues and behavior problems. All of this can significantly affect the 
                  child’s academic performance and <a className="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4075951/">overall wellbeing</a>. One <a className="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41539-019-0055-z">study</a> showed that better 
                  quality, longer duration, and greater consistency of <strong>sleep correlated with better
                   grades</strong>. Several <a className="link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32316249/">other studies</a> suggested that students with poor sleep get worse 
                   grades in various exams too. Not getting enough sleep increases <strong>daily sleepiness </strong> 
                   and the <strong>ability to learn</strong> which can naturally have an effect on grades.
            </p><p className="article-text">
                How can we help teens get better sleep and academic performance? One way which has been
                 shown to be very beneficial is slightly delaying school starts times – usually by 
                 30-45minutes to <strong>at least 8:30am</strong>. A real-world study performed in The Seattle School 
                 District in the US delayed class times from 07:50 to 08:45 am and found that students 
                 got on average <strong>34 min longer sleep duration</strong>, which was associated with a <a className="link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aau6200">4.5% increase</a> in
                    the median grades and an <strong>improvement in attendance</strong>. Delaying school start times 
                  also minimizes the difficulty of staying awake during lessons by reducing the levels
                  of daytime sleepiness.
            </p><p className="article-text">
                Most cross-sectional and longitudinal studies reported an <strong>increase in total minutes 
                of sleep</strong> following later school start times, as well as <a className="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7177233/">improved academic performance</a> too. One US <a className="link" href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/162769">study</a> conducted on 9000 adolescents found that academic performance 
                outcomes, including grades earned in core subject areas of math, English, science and 
                social studies, plus performance on state and national achievement tests, attendance 
                rates and reduced tardiness showed significantly positive improvement with the later
                 start times of 8:35am or later. Furthermore, the same study evaluated several other 
                 factors. The number of <strong>car accidents</strong> among teen drivers was reduced by <strong>as much as 70% </strong> 
                 in the same study. On the other hand, teens getting <strong>less than eight hours of sleep </strong> 
                 reported significantly higher <strong>depression</strong> symptoms, greater use of caffeine, and are
                  at greater risk for making poor choices for <strong>substance use</strong>. <a className="link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7177233/#B107-ijerph-17-02574">Other positive effects</a>  of later school times confirmed by most studies which evaluated this were an
                   increase in <strong>positive mood</strong> among students, increased <strong>class attendance</strong> and 
                   significant enhancement of <strong>attention levels</strong> during class, along with <strong>faster
                    reaction time</strong> and improved <strong>memory</strong>.
            </p><p className="article-text">
                Overall, there is a strong scientific foundation connecting <strong>short sleep and poor 
                academic performance</strong>. While it is difficult, or impossible, to stop the adolescents’
                 internal circadian clock getting delayed by approximately 2 hours in puberty, delaying
                  school starting times to at least 8:30am seems like a much more feasible solution for
                   most schools to accommodate for the natural sleep phase delay. While it will likely 
                   not make everybody get straight A’s in class, it is likely going to, at least slightly, 
                   improve performance by the virtue of feeling more rested, concentrated, in a better 
                mood and less sleepy. And don’t forget, if the only impact of delaying school start 
                times was on reducing the number of teen car accidents, I think it would be a 
                no-brainer for every single parent around the globe.
